# Logistic_regression
Individual project for the marketing analytics course.The aim is to create a Logistic regression package. Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.It can help you understand relationships, estimate the probability and predict outcomes, thus helping you to make informed decisions. In marketing, you can use the model to predict if a targeted group of customers will buy a new product or not, to separate groups and get better understanding about the data we have.
